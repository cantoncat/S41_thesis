This paper mainly studied the effect of variable speed limits control in the tunnel sections of a mountainous expressway. In this study, VISSIM simulation is adopted to investigate the safety improvement that the variable speed limits control may bring about. The simulation results showed that variable speed limits control has great potential in reducing travel times and delays, suppressing stops and the growing of the queue, mitigating congestion and delaying its occurrence, in return improving traffic stability and safety level. This paper also revealed the significant improvements in terms of road segment evaluation results such as density, speed and throughput while variable speed limits is applied compared to the scenario of static speed limits, validating the positive effect of variable speed limits. 
This paper, however, has two major shortcomings. First, the information provided on the design of variable speed limits is insufficient. This paper described neither the exact variable speed limit values used in the simulation nor the algorithm behind the designing process, only stated that the value has a gradual drop from station to station. Second, the paper tried to use the improvement in congestion related measurements, such as queue length, travel times and delays, to validate the existence of safety improvement without the thorough explanation why they are linked together. It would be safer to adopt single or multiple safety related measurements or indexes. There may also be some typographic issues with the last line of Table 2 and Figure 2.
